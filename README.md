[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/e30c81fb-1182-4304-bcdb-bab90d9019af/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/memory-canoe/deploys)

Goal is to connect all the data and put it on a zoomable timeline.

_This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)._

## Development

Currently using react scripts:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\

Of course, `eject` can be used when ready.
